# red-orchestra-2-web-admin-kicker
This is a sample program that can help you manage the webadmin of RO2 game, kicking out players with high ping.
The code for this program may not be very standard, please forgive. I haven't tried it, but I guess the RS2 background can be completed using similar logic.

requirements:

pip install requests
pip install bs4
